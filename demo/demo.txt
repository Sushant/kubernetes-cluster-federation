DNS resolution magic is for Services NOT Ingress
    Demo (external) and (Internal)
    External (point at a single region thats up, point at single region thats down) Both Should work and be re-routed to a region thats available
    Internal same as above but we can refer to it just by a local name 'nginx.default.kfed'

Federated Ingress shows that Global Load Balancing will route to all clusters that are available

Make a single nginx instance in US.
Make a fully federated nginx instance in Asian and US
All Should have configmaps showing the region




Deploy Service against Federation Controller
Show the DNS direct endpoint checks to see all are alive
Show Global Load Balancer endpoint will hit different locations based on source ip.
Internal Cluster to Cluster service discovery via DNS

1. Deploy Federation Control plane
2. Spin up 2 clusters in different zones
3. Deploy config map to each cluster that shows region name for example.

Show Global Load Balancer working


Add or Change Static asset

Cluster->Cluster dns resolution test
    Deploy another service only in 1 zone.
    Try to access that service from other zone.
